requests
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

This is a poor man's fork of Kenneth Reitz's Requests.

The original API has been maintained, but callbacks for asynchronous calls
have been added, as well as support for Google App Engine.  Several features
have been cut for the time being.  This fork should be considered
EXPERIMENTAL until those features have been reincorporated, and the fork
declared STABLE.

Typical use has not changed:

    >>> r = requests.get('https://github.com')
    >>> print r.status_code
    200

However, a callback can be specified, which will return an RPC object
instead of a response:

    >>> def callback(response, error):
    >>>     print response
    >>>     print error
    >>> r = requests.get('https://github.com', callback=callback)
    >>> r.wait()
    <html>...</html>
    None

Callbacks must be of the above signature (though names can vary).  If the
callback is an instance method, an additional 'self' argument should be
prepended to the argument list, and the method passed as self.method_name.

Currently this fork only supports Python 2.7.  There are also several
features missing, including:

    * redirects
    * sessions
    * multipart file uploads
    * authentication
    * connection pooling

In its current state, this fork is only suitable for communication with
RESTful APIs, which was its original purpose.  It is suitable for use with
regular Python platforms as well as Google App Engine.

For now, contributions aren't expected until the fork stabilises.
